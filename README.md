Before you get started, make sure you have the following:

- 🖥 [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- 📦 [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually installed with Node.js)
- 🔐 [Metamask](https://metamask.io/)
- 💰 [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/neethu-muthu/CertiLink-DApp.git
   cd UI
   
2. Install dependencies

```
npm install
```
```
npm i hardhat
```
```
npm hardhat compile
```
Add a main network to hardhat.config.
- here im using sepolia and infura 
- add your api key for your sepolia from infura
- add your metamask private key 
eg.
```
module.exports = {
  defaultNetwork:"alchemy",
  networks: {
    localhost: {
      url:"http://127.0.0.1:8545/"
    },
    alchemy: {
      url :"your api key of infura or any other accounts",
      accounts:["your metamask private key"]
    }
  },
  solidity: "0.8.20",
};
```
```
npx hardhat node
```
open another terminal in vscode(ctrl+shift+`)

```
npx hardhat ignition deploy ignition/modules/Cert.js
``` 
open another terminal in vscode(ctrl+shift+`)

```
cd UI
npm i 
```
Go to folder src/SCdata

- add Abi code to cert.json file
- add deployed address to deployedaddress.json(deployed address will get after deploying the contract)
  
```
npm run dev
```
- connect your metamask
- issue certificate
- enter details
- make payment in metamask
- after metamask confirm get you certificate by enter your uinique id

## 💻 Frontend Overview

The DApp is designed to be user-friendly and interactive. Here’s what it offers:

- **🏠 Home Page**: Connect your Metamask wallet and easily search for certificates by ID.
  
- **📝 Issue Page**: Admins can issue new certificates by filling out a simple form with course details, candidate name, grade, and issue date.
  
- **📜 Certificate Page**: Displays detailed certificate information fetched directly from the blockchain.

## 🎯 Usage Guide

### Connect to Metamask

Make sure to connect your Metamask wallet before interacting with the DApp:

```javascript
const provider = new BrowserProvider(window.ethereum);
const signer = await provider.getSigner();
```

### Issue a Certificate

Admins can issue new certificates through the **Issue Certificate** page:

```javascript
const tx = await instance.issue(cerid, cname, course, grade, date);
```

### Verify a Certificate

Users can verify certificates by entering the ID on the **Home** page. The data is securely fetched from the blockchain!

## Future Directions 🚀

CertiLink is set to expand with several key updates, including:

1. **Bulk Certificate Issuance**: Admins will be able to issue multiple certificates in one transaction, streamlining the process.
2. **Off-chain Storage**: Incorporating off-chain storage solutions like IPFS for certificate metadata to reduce blockchain data load.
3. **Interoperability**: Enabling certificate verification across multiple DApps for broader credential validation.
4. **Custom Certificate Designs**: Allow organizations to create certificates using customizable templates.
5. **Real-time Notifications**: Implement real-time alerts for certificate issuance and verification via email or in-app notifications.

These updates will enhance CertiLink’s scalability, efficiency, and user experience.
