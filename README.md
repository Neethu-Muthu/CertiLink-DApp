# 🎓 Certificate DApp

Welcome to the **Certificate DApp**! This decentralized application (DApp) provides a seamless solution for issuing and verifying educational certificates using blockchain technology. Built on Ethereum, the DApp ensures the authenticity and integrity of certificates, making them tamper-proof and easily verifiable.

## 🌟 Features

- **Issue Certificates**: Authorized administrators can issue certificates to students with details such as course name, grade, and date of completion.
- **Verify Certificates**: Anyone can verify the authenticity of a certificate by entering the certificate ID.
- **Blockchain Security**: All certificates are stored on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring they cannot be altered or forged.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project locally, you need to have:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed
- [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) extension added to your browser
- An Ethereum wallet with some testnet ETH for transactions

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/certificate-dapp.git
   cd certificate-dapp

   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the local development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Deploy the smart contract to your preferred Ethereum network:

   ```bash
   truffle migrate --network <network-name>
   ```

## 💻 Frontend Overview

The frontend is built with React, and it interacts with the Ethereum blockchain via `ethers.js`. Here’s how it works:

- **Home Component**: Allows users to connect their Metamask wallet and search for certificates using an ID.
- **Issue Page**: Admins can issue new certificates by filling in details like course name, candidate name, grade, and issue date.
- **Certificate Component**: Displays the certificate details fetched from the blockchain based on the entered ID.

### 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

- **Solidity**: For smart contract development.
- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Ethers.js**: For blockchain interaction.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the frontend components.

## 🎯 Usage

### Connect to Metamask

Before interacting with the DApp, make sure to connect your Metamask wallet:

```javascript
const provider = new BrowserProvider(window.ethereum);
const signer = await provider.getSigner();
```

### Issue a Certificate

Admins can issue a new certificate by navigating to the **Issue Certificate** page, filling in the required details, and submitting the form.

### Verify a Certificate

Users can verify a certificate by entering its ID on the **Home** page. The certificate details are fetched directly from the blockchain.
